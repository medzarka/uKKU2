This the second version for the Academic Quality Document Management for the KSA universities.

This software is developed by Mohamed ZARKA (medzarka@gmail.com) at the King Khalid University.

In this second version, the software handles both measurement and quality related documents. It provides also a small workflow to validate these documents.
The software is able to edit a section measurement report based on an Excel file containing students marks.

Some issues:
- many data are entered using the Django admin interface. Specific web pages will be welcome.
- The interface uses only the english language. An arabic interface is welcome.
- More work should be done of users permissions.
- The workflow should be revised.

Hope It will be helpful.
